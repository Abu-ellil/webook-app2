4. WHEN the map is too zoomed out THEN the system SHALL group seats visually for performance
5. WHEN providing a reset button THEN the system SHALL return to the default view position and zoom

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the seat map to perform well with thousands of seats, so that the interface remains responsive during interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering many seats THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance (>30 FPS)
2. WHEN zooming out THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail rendering to improve performance
3. WHEN panning THEN the system SHALL only render visible seats to optimize performance
4. WHEN selecting seats THEN the system SHALL update the display without noticeable lag
5. WHEN the canvas size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the rendering accordingly
